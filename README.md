# Stomp
A game where you can experience what it's like to be that bug you crushed!

Use A/D to move left and right, and avoid the people trying to crush you. It's quite simple, really.


# Running from source
To run the source code, you'll need to have python installed, as well as the pygame-ce module.
After installing python, pygame-ce can be installed by running the following command in a terminal:

pip3 install pygame-ce

If that doesn't work, try just "pip" rather than "pip3"

After installed everything, just run the main.py script from a terminal by doing the following command:

python3 <path_to_main.py_script>

You might need to replace "python3" with just "python".
